It’s been several weeks into my Flatiron experience and I’ve learned a lot about both coding and myself.

What I’ve learned about coding is that you can do it if you stick to it and devote yourself to it. You can’t come into a bootcamp and just kinda do it. You have to devote yourself completely to the work and give it all the time you have. I’ve been putting in long days and nights to keep up. You can’t underestimate the time involved. 

Most of the blogs I’ve read about the bootcamp experience detail a particular coding issue that someone has solved. I’ve never come across one that details the time commitment and the blood, sweat, and tears that it’ll take to get through the process. You need to understand the amount of time it’ll take and allocate your time accordingly. If you do that you’ll solve plenty of coding issues if you give yourself the time to dedicate to the daily work required.

Underestimating the time requirement is probably the biggest issue I’ve encountered so far and I’ve given myself 80 hours a week for school work. Given the fact that the work is online and you are being taught to solve issues for yourself, it’s more than just reading the lessons and doing some coding, at least it’s been that way for me. I spend a lot of time on Stack Overflow and various Ruby sites looking at information in the Ruby docs about syntax and best practices. There no doubt that the lessons are comprehensive but there’s a lot of other time you’ll need to allocate to doing additional research in outside sources.

What I’ve learned about myself is that there will be plenty of emotional ups and downs. I’ve suffered from imposter syndrome more times than I can count and have ridden the emotional rollercoaster each week. It’s a day to day thing and I never know how things are going to pan out. It’s a tough path and there’s a lot of reasons to want to throw your computer out the window but I’ve learned that I can and will get through it. 

One of the upsides is that there’s plenty of support from both my cohort and the various Flatiron folks who work with my cohort. You can reach out almost any time of day and have someone to talk things out with. You also get access to Flatiron’s Ask A Question service. Staffed by graduates who have been trained to help, they do their best to help with any problems you might have. All this means that you aren’t going to be alone. When you are stuck on an issue and really need help there are sympathetic ears and answers to be had.

As I progress into my first project week it started off well but then I lost all of today to computer problems. It’s not been the best of days but I know that tomorrow when I get up early, brew my coffee, and sit down to code that I’ll be able to reach out for assistance if I need it. I’ll be able to find an ear to sympathize with me and tell me that I’ll come out of this successfully having completed my project. 

No roadblock is too much to overcome with the help and support that Flatiron and your fellow cohort members provide. Give yourself the time to get the work done and reach out for help when you need it!
