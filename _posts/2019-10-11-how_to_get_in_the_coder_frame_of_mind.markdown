My first week here at Flatiron in done and in the books. It was a week of both highs and lows. There was a lot, and I mean a lot, of information thrown at us when you aren’t used to sitting and reading and coding all day for a week. That’s part of the boot camp experience. It’s a grind, a short but very intense grind.

I have plenty of things this week that hung me up and I had to find my way around but so did everyone else. I don’t think I’d have anything to add at this point to the conversation that would be enlightening or earth-shattering. I struggled along and spent a lot of time Googling the error codes that became my best friends. What I did dial in was my method for getting through eight and ten hour days reading the lessons and coding the labs. That’s what I’m going to share here. 

The most important thing I found this week that helped me was getting in the proper mindset. Becoming a coder is something that won’t happen to most of us overnight. You need to get psyched up for the grind and have the proper outlook on the day. To begin that process I have a space I work in. I’m lucky to have a room I can shut myself in and work in relative peace. Having a space to call my own for studying is important. Just sitting in the space is enough to start me on the right path. 

If you don’t have a separate space to work in you can carve out a little slice of privacy somewhere in the house. The kitchen table during certain hours. The couch and that makes the TV off limits for a couple of hours. The bedroom with the door closed for a little privacy. That special tree in the yard where the wifi just barely reaches. Maybe it’s the local coffee shop. Wherever it is make it your own.

Another big part of the process is letting those you share your living space with you know that when you’re in your “special place” you are in school and shouldn’t be disturbed. That isn’t always easy. Kids don’t always understand the need for space while studying. Roommates don’t either for that matter. Set firm boundaries for your study time.

You can take it a step further and wear a “school outfit”. I have a hat that says :coder on it. When I’m wearing that hat I’m in school even if I’m in the kitchen making a cup of tea. It helps to let those in the house know that I’m focused on school and to give me my space. You could wear a hat, a tie, a sweater, or a favorite set of pajamas. Whatever gets you into that headspace works.

Having the proper ambiance can also help. My cohort talked about listening to various kinds of music to help focus them on the task at hand. I listen to either a thunderstorm (YouTube has plenty of ten-hour options for you to choose from) or video game or movie soundtracks. They fade into the background and allow a small part of your brain to enjoy them without all of your brain getting sucked into the void of coding.

Take some time this weekend to think about what it is that you can do to make your space more coder friendly and help those who share your space understand coding is hard and it takes your total attention to get through it. You’ll be a better coder for it!
