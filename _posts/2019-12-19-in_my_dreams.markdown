One of the ways I know I’m really absorbing something is when I begin to dream about it. No matter what I may be learning, that is the benchmark that it’s become a force in my life and I’m beginning to get it.

Being in an online bootcamp like Flatiron is, as one of my instructors described it, like being hit with a firehose of information. You are inundated daily with information and it can be overwhelming at first. There was so much thrown at me that I wasn’t processing all the nuances and the interconnections. 

Once I had my first coding dream I knew I’d crossed a line. My brain was moving into the space of coding and I was advancing to the next level. After spending two weeks in bed with the flu and not coding at all it took a while to flip that switch and get back into. The last few days I’ve been coding in my sleep so I know I’m back and have the right mindset.  

Now I just need to learn to solve my labs in my sleep!
