As they say, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” When I began my bootcamp I had a plan to handle my son graduating from Air Force Officer Training School. Everything was going according to plan until, as the saying goes, things went awry.

I was taken out by the flu. I can hear you out there thinking, “Well, he should have gotten a flu shot!” Yeah, well the irony here is I did for the first time in my life and still picked up a strain of the flu that it didn’t protect against. I spent the better part of two weeks laying in bed hoping the end was coming to claim me since that would be infinitely better than the way I was feeling.

Now I’m up against the wall and coding my brains out to get my Sinatra project done. The best laid plans may go awry but sometimes you just have to put on some big boy pants and try to salvage things as best you can. That’s what I’m doing now...a salvage operation.
